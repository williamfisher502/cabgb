<h2>About CABGB</h2>
<p>We started as just a few individuals who went to the supposed Black Goose Bistro location, and found nothing! It wasn't even a real restaurant! We have been lied to! All we wanted to do was go to this heavily advertiesed
restaurant and try some of their food, but nope! It was at that moment that we decided to take matters into our own hands, and that was when we founded the CABGB. Since then, we have gotten many more members over the months
the CABGB was founded. We now have over 300 members, with our great founder Jerominio Hastferson leading us. We here at the CABGB won't stand for the Black Goose Bistro's lies anymore, and we implore you to join our cause!</p>
