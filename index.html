<h2>Our Cause</h2>
<p>The Black Goose Bistro restaurant has been lying to us. We are sick of the restaurant advertising all their foods without even having a real location! The reviews they post are fake, the food is fake, everything is fake!
The whole site is likely a marketing scheme for some big company or a kid's school project, and we won't stand for it! We decided to make our site look just like theirs to show you how easy it is to fake a site! We here at
CABGB will not stand for Black Goose Bistro's lies any longer! Join our cause today!</p>
